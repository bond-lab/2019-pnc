<h1>PNC 2019 Keynotes</h1>

<img  src='pics/vanessa.jpg'>
<h2><a name="evers">Prof. Vanessa Evers</a></h2>

<p>Director, Institute of Science and Technology for
  Humanity (NISTH),
  <br>Nanyang Technological University

<p>Vanessa Evers is a chair and Professor of Human Media Interaction, University of
Twente, the Netherlands. She is also vice-dean of research for the Faculty of Electrical
Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science and the Scientific Director and
founder of the DesignLab, a centre for multidisciplinary projects with societal impact
based on 'Science to Design for Society'.
<p>Vanessa has studied Information Systems at the University of Amsterdam,
Business Information Science at UNSW, Sydney and has a PhD from the Open
University UK. She has worked for the Boston Consulting Group has been a visiting
Scholar at Stanford University, and a part-time professorship at the University of Delft.
<p>Her work exists at the intersection of Computer Science, Psychology, Design,
Philosophy and Electrical Engineering and focusses on human interaction with
artificially intelligent systems and cultural aspects of Human Computer Interaction. It
covers design of Artificially Intelligent systems that are able to interpret human social
behaviours and respond to people in a socially acceptable way as well as the evaluation
of the impact of such technology on people and society. She is a frequent public speaker
in the media and at international fora such as the World Economic
  Forum at Davos.
  <h3>Socially Intelligent Robotics</h3>
  <h4>Dr. Vanessa Evers</h4>
<p>The current expectation is that artificially intelligent systems
  such as robots or personal voice agents will be integrated into
  every aspect of our lives be it home-life, work, leisure, care or
  education. To ensure that this process happens in a responsible and
  seamless way I pose the theory that robots must be able to learn
  socially from people. I will argue that social norms, embedded in
  people and the context of use must be taken into account when
  designing artificially intelligent technology and must be
  interpreted automatically. Specifically, I will address the
  following questions:
  <ul>
<li> How do people learn and what is the role of culture?
<li> Can AI achieve social intelligence?
<li> How can the design of robots and their social behaviour impact acceptance and optimize collaboration?
</ul>
<p>By discussing my groups' previous research which involved practical deployments of robots in the real world, I will explore the fundamentally social relationship people have with autonomous robots and offer essential rules for effective human-robot collaboration

<h3>Technology Enhanced Adaptive Learning in Taiwan</h3>
<h4>Dr. Bor-Chen Kuo</h4>

<p>In 2017, the Ministry of Education, Taiwan, launched an adaptive learning and
assessment platform called Taiwan Competence based Adaptive Learning System
  (TCALS)
  (<a href="http://adaptive-learning.moe.edu.tw/">http://adaptive-learning.moe.edu.tw/</a>). TCALS was developed based on
knowledge structure with prerequisite relationship and uses information technology to
deliver customized resources and orchestrate learning activities in order to adapt to the
unique learning needs of individual learners. In TCALS, there are thousands of videos
for micro-learning, items for instant diagnosing, interactive modules, intelligent
tutoring agents and assessments of 21 st century competences for supporting learning
through scaffolds.
<p>TCALS has been widely used in many primary and secondary schools, such as
ICT instruction, flipped classroom, remedial instruction, and self-regulated learning.
Research evidences in support of the effectiveness of the system for adaptive teaching
and learning will be demonstrated. Additionally, data mining techniques were applied
to analyze student's learning behaviors and records and the findings will be also
presented.

  <h3>Digital Humanities and the Study of Singaporean Cultural History</h3>
<h4>Prof. Kenneth Dean</h4>
<p>The Chinese Studies Department of NUS has developed a Singapore Historical
GIS (SHGIS) as well as a Singapore Biographical Database (SBDB). This talk will
outline the features of these two on-line databases and discuss ongoing efforts to expand
and link these databases. One set of new data we hope to add in is a TEI marked up
version of Chinese Epigraphy of Singapore: 1819-1911, which provides the names of
over 50,000 individuals who contributed to over 70 temples and huiguan. Another data
set is the digitized version of the Bukit Brown Burial Record (1922-1972) with the
names of over 68,000 individuals. The talk will also discuss the possibility of developing
a common digital platform for the Chinese diaspora across Southeast
  Asia.

  <h3>Building Sustainable Society by Using Information and
    Communication Technology: <br>Lessons from Disaster Management</h3>
  <h4>Prof. Yue Gau Chen</h4>
<p>The modern society has become multi-functional to support individuals therein
surviving and developing altogether. Given good and efficient functions, a society may
expand beyond million individuals as large as cities and countries. To keep such a
gigantic system running is a complicated daily course for the management level. The
entire system is actually composed of numerous sub-systems, which rely on each other
at some points. Anything goes wrong in one sub-system would affect the normal
function of not only the system itself, but also other systems related. Such a dependence
is commonly recognized as the risk in maintaining our society to be sustainable. It is
also considered as the vulnerability when we assess the impacts of disaster’s strikes.
The overall societal performance actually depends on the vulnerabilities of all
components that constitutes the society. Therefore to strengthen the societal resilience
has to take all components into account. In terms of hazard themselves on the other
hand, different natural hazard is caused by its own physics happening above or beneath
Earth’s surface. For the purpose of hazard mitigation and prevention of specific hazard,
it requires relevant knowledge to lower the societal vulnerability for all subsystems
including the central governance system. All related approaches for the action can be
defined to societal resilience building.
<p>One of above actions, of common in applications on all kinds of hazards, is the
information distribution via efficient communication ways. It is of unequivocal
essential in a modern society in addition to basic life-supporting systems. Some of the
communication technologies, i.e., internet and cellphone, have provided us no-blind-
spot and non-stop service, fulfilling high-end demand of well-developed society. For
hazard managements they are also of critical. In particular during a disaster happening
time, rapid and efficient information distribution can significantly strengthen the
resilience and save possible loss. In the past, though we had radio or television, the
hazard information were mainly collected by oral reporting. Nowadays imagery or
video monitoring systems have become increasingly common than before. Such a big-
data input needs auto-managing system to diagnose and analyze before reporting to the
decision maker and then to the public. The broadcasting to the public has been also
rapidly evolved and mainstreamed by new medias, i.e., internet webpage and social
media platform. They can play even better role than traditional tools on information
distribution while considering the effectiveness. Moreover, internet is a two-way
communicating platform. Instantaneous information searching and grabbing can be
utilized as a new input source, which helps quite a lot for information updates. Since
the disasters are inevitable to a society, resilience building for all societal components
is necessary, especially by using new information and communication technology.

  <h3>Agriculture Biodiversity Challenge and Agro-Ecology <br>for Climate
Change Resilience and Food Security in ASEAN</h3>
<h4>Dr. The Anh Dao</h4>

<p>The Southeast Asian comprises found to be one of the 25 global biodiversity
hotspots which is the highest biodiversity centers in the world. All of 10 member states
are Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The Agro-biodiversity is
expressed through diversity in ecosystems, species composition and genetic resources
as well. Agro-biodiversity makes a significant contribution to each country economy,
providing a basis for ensuring food security, maintaining genetic resources of animals
and plants; and providing materials for construction, fuel and pharmaceutical resources.
<p>Agro-biodiversity has changed significantly in ASEAN countries. Through
agricultural intensification, many drivers affecting these changes including changes in
land and water use and management, pollution and external inputs, over-exploitation
and overharvesting, climate change, natural disasters, pests, diseases, alien invasive
species, markets, trade, policies, population growth and urbanization, changing
economic, socio-political, and cultural factors, advancements and innovations in
science and technology. Of these, the pressure from the increasing human population
combined with an increasing level of consumption which is resulting in
overexploitation of biodiversity resources. In addition, land conversion and
infrastructure construction has significantly reduced the area of natural habitats,
increased ecosystem fragmentation, and degraded the habitats of many species of wild
plants and animals. Natural resources, especially biological resources, are undergoing
overexploitation. Of these, timber, non-timber and aquatic products are particularly
vulnerable. Furthermore, alien species, environment pollution and climate change are
all directly affecting the biodiversity. The agricultural intensification has created a lot
of negative externalities in Vietnam and ASEAN.

<p>   There remain some challenges in achieving good management of biodiversity,
including: (1) lack of effective inter-sectoral coordination mechanisms to respond to
overlap in functions among relevant ministries and agencies; laws and regulations to
protect biodiversity are still unsystematic and lacking in uniformity; (2) community
involvement in biodiversity conservation has not been sufficiently mobilized, which
leads to weak law enforcement; deforestation and illegal wildlife trade pose serious
threats to biodiversity; (3) overall investments in biodiversity are insufficient, resulting
in a lack of financial, human and technological resources. In the long run, Vietnam and
other ASEAN countries have to find a balance between protectionism and sensible
access to their national agriculture biodiversity to tackle challenges in biodiversity
conservation, health issues, food security and climate change. In order to find the
solution, the conventional agricultural intensification approach should be changed to
agro-ecology, with ecological intensification principle, creating more positive
externalities through eco-system services. The agro-ecology will find a trade-off
between producing biomass for food security and protecting biodiversity for a climate
resilience in our future.
