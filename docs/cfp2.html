<h3>Full Paper Submission</h3>


<p>Authors are invited to submit full papers through
the <a href='https://conference.iis.sinica.edu.tw/surl/pnc2019/sub'>online
  submission system</a> by Jun 15, 2019 (extended). The final manuscript (camera
ready) should be ready by August 16, 2019. Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously while being evaluated for this conference. The paper length is 6-8 pages, including figures and tables but not including references. All submitted papers must conform to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html ">IEEE Xplore Format</a> for conference proceedings. 


<p>As the reviewing will be blind, papers must not include authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.


<p>Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. For example, do not omit or redact important citation information to preserve anonymity. Instead, use third person or named reference to this work, as described above (“Smith showed” rather than “we showed”).


<h3>Artwork, Poster and Vendor Submission</h3>


<p>Artists, designers and practice-based researchers engaging in
  computational and communications media and technology are invited to
  submit proposals for exhibiting work that responds to this year's
  conference themes of “Regionality, Digital Humanities and
  South-South Connections”.  Authors are invited to submit abstracts
  (max. 500 words) by Jun 15, 2019. For  the poster competition, participants are required to give an oral orientation. The best poster award will be selected after evaluation by the Grading Committee. 　Vendors or Institutions are welcome to take this opportunity to show research results that are related to the conference main theme.
